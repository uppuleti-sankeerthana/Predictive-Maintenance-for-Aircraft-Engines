#Predictive-Maintenance-for-Aircraft-Engines
Predictive Maintenance for Aircraft Engines 

Project Overview: 
This project focuses on leveraging predictive maintenance methods to assess the condition of aircraft engines and plan maintenance/failure ahead of time. Through a comprehensive approach, we explored various techniques for both classification and regression tasks, aiming to predict system failures and estimate remaining useful life (RUL) accurately.

The objective of this project is to implement various Predictive Maintenance methods and assess the performance of each. Each method can be classified broadly into two categories.

1. Classification: Predicting the failure of machine in upcoming n days
2. Regression: Predicting the remaining useful life of a machine 

## Data
Data sets consists of multiple multivariate time series. Each time series is from a different engine â€“ i.e., the data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type. You can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps).

The engine is operating normally at the start of each time series, and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. In the test set, the time series ends some time prior to system failure. 

The training set includes operational data from 100 different engines. The lengths of the run varied with a minimum run length of 128 cycles and the maximum length of 356 cylces. The testing set includes operational data from 100 different engines. The engines in the test dataset and copletely different from engines in the training data set.


Key Components: 
1. Data Exploration & Understanding
We delved into multivariate time series data, representing operational data from a fleet of aircraft engines. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we gained insights into engine performance and fault development patterns.

2. Model Implementation
We implemented a diverse range of models, including exponential degradation models, similarity-based approaches, LSTM networks, and 1D CNNs, tailored for both RUL prediction and binary/multiclass classification of system failure.

3. Evaluation & Performance Assessment
Rigorous evaluation metrics were employed to assess the performance of each predictive maintenance method, ensuring reliability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

4. Deployment & Impact
This project holds the potential to revolutionize aircraft maintenance practices, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling, minimizing downtime, and optimizing resource allocation for enhanced safety and efficiency in aviation operations.

Project Impact: 
By harnessing the power of data-driven predictive maintenance, we aim to empower aviation stakeholders with actionable insights for proactive maintenance planning, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and safety standards in the aerospace industry.
